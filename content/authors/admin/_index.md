My main research interests lie in the experimental study of human social interaction and communication, and in the cultural transmission of these behaviors and their outcomes. I make use of artificial language games to study the emergence and evolution of communication, and also study the interactions of humans in constrained, large-scale online environments to learn more about the change and organization of cultural traits. Currently I am extending this approach to study hybrid human-machine interaction in my position at the Center for Humans and Machines at the MPIB.
